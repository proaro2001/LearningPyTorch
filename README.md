# LearningPyTorch

Welcome to the LearningPyTorch Project! This project is designed to showcase my learning journey in Deep Learning and Machine Learning with [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) by following and watching YouTube tutorials from [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/). In this repository, you will find the code, documentation, and resources related to the tutorials I have explored.

# Project Description
The primary objective of this project is to showcase my understanding of PyTorch. Currently, the project primarily focuses on the fundamentals of using PyTorch for linear regression, where I have gained proficiency in implementing regression models and predicting outcomes based on given input data.

Moving forward, I am actively expanding my knowledge to include the exciting domain of neural network classification. 

# Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:
1. Sign in to your Google account.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook file.
Click on the "Open in Colab" button at the top of the Jupyter Notebook file.
3. Review the code and instructions in the notebook.
4. Execute the code using the shortcut Shift+Enter or Ctrl+F9 to run all the code and observe the results within the notebook interface.
